The resistor only adds a discharge path for the shared charge, which allows current to leak *out* of the capacitors, and makes the circuit worse. So why bother with it at all? The reason is the $100k\\Omega$ resistor helps stabilize the $V_{+}$ node. This node is completely disconnected from any power or ground. The input resistance of the Op Amp is infinite. Thus, if the resistor is not there, the $V_{+}$ node is left completely floating. Floating nodes are traditionally not very stable (as the name might also imply) and are very susceptible to background electrical interference. By draining the shared charge slowly, this creates a reference to ground, making the node stable, increasing the repeatability and robustness of the circuit."
