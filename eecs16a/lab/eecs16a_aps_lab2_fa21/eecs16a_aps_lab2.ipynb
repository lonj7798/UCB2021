    "Suppose we have $N$ beacons $\\vec{a}_0,~\\vec{a}_1,~\\cdots,~\\vec{a}_{N - 1}$, so the position of a beacon $\\vec{a}_i$ in the 2-D plane will be $\\vec{a}_i = [a_{i,x}, a_{i ,y}]^T$. These positions are known. We also have a receiver $\\vec{r}$ with unknown position $\\vec{r}=[r_x, r_y]^T$ in the same plane. Let $d_i$ denote the distance of $a_i$ to $\\vec{r}$, $d_i = \\sqrt{(r_x - a_{i, x})^2 + (r_y - a_{i, y})^2}$. \n",

    "For simplification, in this lab we use beacon 0 as a reference placed at the origin, i.e., $\\vec{a}_0 = [a_{0,x}, a_{0 ,y}]^T = [0, 0]^T$. We also let $\\tau_0$, $\\tau_1$ ... $\\tau_{n - 1}$ denote the TDOA's. Since we are referencing all the beacons to beacon 0, we also define $\\Delta\\tau_m = \\tau_m - \\tau_0 $. \n",
