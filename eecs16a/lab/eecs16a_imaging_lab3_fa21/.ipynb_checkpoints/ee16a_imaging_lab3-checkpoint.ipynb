    "This week, you will experiment with imaging methods that illuminate *multiple pixels* at a time. The multipixel illumination patterns displayed by the projector will come from a random binary matrix that you will generate. Before performing real imaging with the projector and light sensor (phototransistor) circuit, you will first step through a simulation procedure that helps you understand how multipixel imaging works (with an encryption-y spin). You will get a little taste of \"practical engineering\" (i.e. why translating theory into practice isn't as easy as it looks). After that, you'll apply these insights to real multipixel imaging, and then see a cool \"trick of the trade\" that allows you to more quickly image your drawing and get a robust result!\n",

As an example, for a 2x2 image, $H$ would need exactly 4 rows (one for each mask), and we would make 4 scans.\n",

Unfortunately, due to real-world non-idealities alluded to earlier, if you directly tried to image a drawing with the multipixel masks in $H$, the reconstruction would probably look terrible. A significant amount of engineering effort is focused on how to best translate theory into practice by attempting to compensate for or remove non-idealities. In the following sections, we'll look at some of the worst offenders and what we can do to improve reconstruction quality. \n",

Noise is what causes photos to look grainy or fuzzy. As an example, if your single pixel imaging system from last week happened to be very noisy (and usually, the cheaper $ the system, the noisier it is...), imaging the card from before might've produced something like: <br/><br/>\n",

At the same time, the amount of noise coming from the light sensor circuit and projector should stay mostly constant, thus improving the so-called *signal-to-noise ratio* (SNR) of our system. This is important to know when choosing `avg1sPerRow` for our random binary mask.\n",

Diagonalization is not a concept you have learned yet, it will be covered in EECS16B, but for this lab, take our word that the $H$ matrix has $N$ linearly independent eigenvectors because of this property. With this, we know that the eigenvectors of $H$ form a basis for $\\mathbb{R}^N$, that is, a linearly independent set of vectors that span $\\mathbb{R}^N$.
